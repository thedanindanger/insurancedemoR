# Insurance Analysis Demo

## Before you begin
Download R from CRAN and RStudio Community

* https://cloud.r-project.org/

* RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

## Getting the files
If you're unfamiliar with github, you can download all files with the green 'Clone or Download' button close to the upper right of your screen

## Using R Markdown
R Markdown lets you run blocks of code inside your script, then print out the whole thing in HTML or PDF.

Use RStudio to open the .rmd R Markdown file insuranceDeme.Rmd

Run the grey 'Code Chunks' with your respective keyboard shortcuts. Details here: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html

You will need to install several packages as you process the data. The R terminal will give bright red text telling you what to install. Follow these instructions to get packages: https://astrobiomike.github.io/R/installing_packages
